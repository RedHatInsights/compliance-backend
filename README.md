# Cloud Services for RHEL: Compliance Backend

compliance-backend is a project meant to parse OpenSCAP reports into a database,
and perform all kind of actions that will make your systems more compliant with
a policy. For example, you should be able to generate reports of all kinds for
your auditors, get alerts, and create playbooks to fix your hosts.


## Getting started

This project does two main things:

1 - Connect to a Kafka message queue [provided by the Insights Platform](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-upload)
2 - Serve as the API backend for the web UI [compliance-frontend](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/compliance-frontend) and for other consumers.

Let's examine how to run the project:

### Option 1: [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/)

You may use the templates in `openshift/templates/` and upload them to
Openshift to run the project without any further configuration. The template uses two docker images:
[`quarck/ruby25-openscap`](https://hub.docker.com/r/quarck/ruby25-openscap/) and [`centos/postgresql-96-centos7`](https://hub.docker.com/r/centos/postgresql-96-centos7/).

#### Prerequisites

* [`ocdeployer`](https://github.com/bsquizz/ocdeployer)

#### Deploy

```shell
ocdeployer -s compliance your_openshift_project
```

### Option 2: Development setup

compliance-backend is a Ruby on Rails application. It should run using
at least two different processes:

#### Shared prerequisites

Prerequisites:

* URL to Kafka
  - environment variable: `KAFKAMQ`
* URL to PostgreSQL database
  - environment variables: `POSTGRESQL_DATABASE`, `POSTGRESQL_SERVICE_HOST`, `POSTGRESQL_USER`, `POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRESQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `DATABASE_SERVICE_NAME`

First, let's install all dependencies and initialize the database.

```shell
bundle install
bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate
```

#### Kafka consumers (XCCDF report consumers)

At this point you can launch as many ['racecar'](https://github.com/zendesk/racecar)
processes as you want. These processes will become part of a *consumer group*
in Kafka, so by default the system is highly available.

To run a Reports consumer:

```shell
KAFKAMQ=localhost:29092 bundle exec racecar ComplianceReportsConsumer
```

#### Web server

You may simply run:

```shell
bundle exec rails server
```

Notice there's no CORS protection by default. If you want your requests to be
CORS-protected, check out `config/initializers/cors.rb` and change it to only
allow a certain domain.

After this, make sure you can redirect your requests to your the backend's port 3000
using insights-proxy. You may run the proxy using the SPANDX config provided here:

```ruby
SPANDX_CONFIG=$(pwd)/compliance-backend.js ../insights-proxy/scripts/run.sh
```

### Option 3: Docker/Podman Compose Development setup

The first step is to copy over the .env file from .env.example and modify the
values as needed:

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

You may also need to add basic auth to `app/services/platform.rb`. This
authentication will be used when talking to platform services such as inventory,
rbac, and remediations. Anything not deployed locally will require basic auth
instead of using an identity header (i.e. rbac, remediations):

```diff
diff --git a/app/services/platform.rb b/app/services/platform.rb
index 36a0f00..c4b0e92 100644
--- a/app/services/platform.rb
+++ b/app/services/platform.rb
@@ -21,6 +21,7 @@ module Platform
       f.request :retry, RETRY_OPTIONS
       f.adapter Faraday.default_adapter # this must be the last middleware
       f.ssl[:verify] = Rails.env.production?
+      f.basic_auth 'username', 'password'
     end
     faraday
   end
```

Either podman-compose or docker-compose should work. podman-compose does not
support exec, so podman commands must be run manually against the running
container, as demonstrated:

```shell
# docker
docker-compose exec rails bash

# podman
podman exec compliance-backend_rails_1 bash
```

Bring up the everything, including inventory, ingress, etc.:

```shell
docker-compose up
```

Access the rails console:

```shell
docker-compose exec rails bundle exec rails console
```

Debug with pry-remote:

```shell
docker-compose exec rails pry-remote -w
```

Run the tests:

```shell
# run all tests (same thing run on PRs to master)
docker-compose exec rails bundle exec rake test:validate

# run a single test file
docker-compose exec -e TEST=$TEST rails bundle exec rake test TEST=test/consumers/inventory_events_consumer_test.rb
```

Access logs:
note: podman-compose does not support the logs command, so similar to exec,
it must be run against the container itself, as shown

```shell
docker-compose logs -f sidekiq

# podman
podman logs -f compliance-backend_sidekiq_1
```

## Development notes

### Creating hosts in the inventory

To create hosts in the inventory the `kafka_producer.py` script can be used from the `inventory` container:

```
docker-compose run -e NUM_HOSTS=1000 -e INVENTORY_HOST_ACCOUNT=00001 inventory-web bash -c 'pipenv install --system --dev; python3 ./utils/kafka_producer.py;'
```

## API documentation

The API documentation can be found at `Settings.path_prefix/Settings.app_name`. To generate the docs, run `rake rswag:specs:swaggerize`. You may also get the OpenAPI definition at `Settings.path_prefix/Settings.app_name/v1/openapi.json`
The OpenAPI version 3.0 description can be found at `Settings.path_prefix/Settings.app_name/openapi`. You can build this API by converting the JSON representation (OpenAPI 2.x) using [swagger2openapi](https://github.com/Mermade/oas-kit/blob/master/packages/swagger2openapi).
